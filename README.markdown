This is an updated version of the active_youtube gem from the [Quark ruby blog](http://www.quarkruby.com/2008/2/12/active-youtube), I couldn't find the original to fork on github.

It works with the YouTube v2 API and provides an interface to Read YouTube data(no CUD access), with no API Key required.

`sudo gem install simple_youtube`

Please look through test/youtube_test.rb for examples of how to use. I have tried to cover most examples from the [YouTube API reference](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/reference.html)

Big Thanks to the Quark crew for the inspiration!!!
