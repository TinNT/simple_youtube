This is an updated version of the active_youtube gem from the Quark ruby blog, I couldn't find the original to fork on github.

It works with the Youtube v2 API and provides an interface to Read Youtube data(no CUD access), with no API Key required.

"sudo gem install simple_youtube"

Please look through test/youtube_test.rb for examples of how to use(i have tried to cover most examples from the Youtube API reference)

Big Thanks to the Quark crew for the inspiration!!!
